📝 Project Description

This project is a fully responsive website built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, designed to showcase modern and customizable web templates for developers. The goal is to create an elegant, user-friendly interface that transitions seamlessly from desktop to mobile.

Our templates are easy to set up, understand, and customize — featuring modular components, reusable UI elements, and a variety of pages developers can adapt to their own projects. This project brings together core front-end skills to deliver a clean, practical, and real-world web experience.
